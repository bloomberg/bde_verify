Name
----
|bv| - static C++-compiler-based checking tool

Synopsis
--------
|bv| ``[options...] [compiler options...] file...``

Description
-----------
The |bv| command performs a variety of checks intended to foster improved
adherence to |BDE| design rules, coding standards, and practices and to detect
potential errors. It is built within the **clang** C++ compiler tool system,
and therefore has access to proper syntax and type information about the
program it is examining, unlike text-based scanning tools. The tool was
originally developed (as ``coolyser``) by `Dietmar Kuhl`_ and is now being
maintained and enhanced by `Hyman Rosen`_. This is the `original project`_ and
this is the `original list of implemented checks`_. (You may need to request
permission from Dietmar to visit those pages.)

If the ``--rewrite=dir`` option is specified, |bv| will make some suggested
changes by itself and place the modified files in the specified directory with
``-rewritten`` appended to the file names. (Not much rewriting is being done
yet; we plan to increase this over time.)

|Bv| is supported on SunOS and Linux. In the BloombergLP development
environment, running ``/opt/bb/bin/``\ |bv| will launch the appropriate
version.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration file allows individual or groups of checks to enabled or
disabled, and specifies the enterprise namespace in which components live. By
default, that namespace is ``BloombergLP``, and almost all checks are enabled.
The configuration file consists of a set of options, one per line, processed
in order. Additional configuration lines may be supplied on the command line
as described above. In particular, specifying ``-cl='load file'`` will
augment the default configuration with the contents of ``file``.

=============================== ===============================================
Config Entry                    Description
=============================== ===============================================
``#`` *text*                    Comment text.
``namespace`` *name*            Enterprise namespace.
``all on``                      Turn all checks on.
``all off``                     Turn all checks off.
``group`` *groupname* *name*... Make *groupname* a synonym for the list of
                                *name*\ s (which may themselves be group
                                names).
``check`` *name* ``on``         Turn specific check or group on.
``check`` *name* ``off``        Turn specific check or group off.
``load`` *file*                 Read and process configuration lines from the
                                *file*.
``set`` *parameter* *value*     Set a parameter used by a check.
``append`` *parameter* *value*  Append to a parameter used by a check.
``prepend`` *parameter* *value* Prepend to a parameter used by a check.
``suppress`` *tag* *files*...   Messages with the specified *tag* are
                                suppressed for the specified *files*. Either
                                *tag* or *files* (but not both) may be ``*``.
                                The *tag* may be a group *name*, suppressing
                                all members (including subgroups).
=============================== ===============================================

If the configuration file attempts to name a non-existent check, the tool will 
report a list of all known checks and then exit. Do this deliberately to 
obtain an accurate list of checks if you suspect this documentation is out of 
date.

Local Suppressions
------------------
The |bv| command can locally suppress or enable individual message tags within 
a source file region, using ``#pragma`` |bv| constructs or ``//`` |BV| 
``pragma:`` structured comments.

Note that programs are often compiled with options that generate warnings for 
unknown pragmas; |bv| defines the macro |BV| to enable enclosing these pragmas 
within ``#ifdef`` |BV| blocks.

Local suppressions operate within a single file, and will not have any effect 
on warnings in files that this file includes or in files that include this one.

Note that this cannot enable a check which was disabled by ``check name off`` 
in the configuration.

Exit Status
-----------
Normally, the exit status of a |bv| run is 0 (success) unless the code has
actual errors.  If a particular check or tag is produced and that check or tag
is set in the *failstatus* configuration parameter, the exit status will be 1
(failure).  This allows for the creation of wrapper scripts whose exit status
indicates that some condition fails to hold.

Checks
------
These are the checks supported by the tool. A few are of dubious value and may
be removed in the future. The tag prefixes (especially the ``TR``\ *nn* ones)
are subject to change as tests are refined or updated. We welcome suggestions
for additional checks.

   ``refactor``
   ++++++++++++
   Uses the rewriting facility to change included files and use of names.
   Specification is done via the parameter ``refactor`` in the configuration
   file.  Use the ``-rewrite`` option to generate the rewritten file.
   
   To replace an included file, specify ``file(old[,new]*)``; the include of
   the old header file will be removed and replaced by the new ones, if any. If
   the old header was surrounded by redundant include guards, the replacements
   will be as well.  E.g., ``append refactor file(bdet_date.h,bdlt_date.h)``.

   To replace a name, specify ``name(old,new)``; the old name should be fully
   elaborated with namespaces and classes, except for the enterprise namespace
   (``BloombergLP``).  Appearances of the old name, elaborated or not, will be
   replaced by the specified new value.  E.g.,
   ``append refactor name(bdetu_DayOfWeek::Day::BDET_WEDNESDAY,e_WEDNESDAY)``.
   Macro names may also be replaced this way; just specify the old and the new.

   * ``RX01``
     Errors in the refactor specification (not in the examined files).
   * ``RF01``
     Replacing included files.

   Spell-checking is disabled by default in the config file
   (``check spell-check off``) to avoid noise.

   Words in configuration parameter ``dictionary`` (default too numerous to
   mention - see config file) are assumed correct.

   Words that appear at least as many times as non-zero configuration
   parameter ``spelled_ok_count`` (default 3) are assumed correct.
